Embedding models transform text or other discrete objects into dense numerical vectors that capture semantic relationships. In the context of retrievalâ€‘augmented generation (RAG), these vectors allow a system to find passages that are semantically similar to a query. Rerankers are models that take the top documents retrieved by the embedding model and score them for relevance to refine the result set. Together, embeddings and reranking reduce hallucinations in AI applications by ensuring that the language model receives accurate and contextually relevant information from the knowledge base before generating a response.
