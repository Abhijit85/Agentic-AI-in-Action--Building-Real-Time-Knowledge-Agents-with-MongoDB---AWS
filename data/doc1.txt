Matryoshka representation learning (MRL) is a technique used in Voyage AI embedding models that allows a single embedding vector to serve at multiple dimensions. The approach trains a large vector (for example a 2048‑dimensional float vector) such that the first k entries of that vector still constitute a meaningful embedding for values of k like 1024, 512 or 256. This nested, “Russian doll” structure gives developers flexibility: they can compute a single high‑dimensional embedding up front and later truncate it to a smaller dimension for faster search or lower storage costs without needing to re‑encode the document. MRL works by applying multiple loss functions during training to pack the most important information into the early dimensions of the embedding.
