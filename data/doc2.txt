Voyage‑3‑large is Voyage AI’s flagship general‑purpose embedding model released in January 2025. It is trained on a diverse set of domains—law, finance, code, web reviews, technical documentation and more—and ranks first across eight evaluated domains spanning one hundred datasets. The model supports multiple embedding sizes of 2048, 1024, 512 and 256 dimensions thanks to Matryoshka learning. It also offers quantization options, returning embeddings as 32‑bit floating point numbers or compressed formats like signed 8‑bit integers and even binary. These options give practitioners a trade‑off between retrieval quality and vector database storage costs; for example a 512‑dimensional binary embedding requires about 200× less storage than a 3072‑dimensional float embedding while still outperforming OpenAI’s latest v3 model on retrieval quality.
