AI agents and retrieval‑augmented generation systems rely on accurate retrieval of information from a knowledge base to answer user questions. Hybrid search combines traditional keyword search with vector search to find both exact and semantic matches. By integrating advanced embedding models, such as those from Voyage AI, and reranking techniques, these systems can produce more trustworthy answers and significantly reduce hallucinations, making them suitable for high‑impact domains like healthcare, legal services and finance.
