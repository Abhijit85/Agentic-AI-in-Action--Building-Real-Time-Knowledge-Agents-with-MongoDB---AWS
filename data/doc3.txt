Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is an AWS offering introduced in mid‑2025 that provides infrastructure and services for building, deploying and operating AI agents.  AgentCore is designed to bridge the gap between proof‑of‑concept prototypes and production‑ready agents. It includes a secure, scalable runtime for long‑running interactive sessions; a memory service that stores both short‑term and long‑term context; an identity service that allows agents to authenticate and access tools; and a gateway for exposing APIs, Lambda functions and existing services as agent‑compatible tools. Additional modules include a code interpreter for executing code in sandboxed environments, a browser tool for interacting with websites, and observability features that integrate with CloudWatch to monitor every action of the agent.
